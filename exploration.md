The main reason I fell in love with Scotland and wanted to move here was a roadtrip through Scotland passing Oban, Skye, and Ullapool. It had some magical moments - helping a farmer find his lost lamb, hearing a local's story about giving birth on a lonely island, watching snow falling into the sea on easter, or being shown around a forgotten island that the local community bought back and is currently rebuilding.

## Islands
The islands are my main fascination. The wilderness, purity, and, if inhabited, often simple and naturalist living and community. I would always happily pack a bag and set off to spend some time on a Scottish island, explore its people, nature, and views.

Below are some places I would like to visit next.

### _Wishlist_
- Mingulay - fulfill my dream of seeing happy puffins
- Islay - tour the various distilleries and find the most peated whisky I can reasonably afford
- Eigg - see how the community lives sustainably and partially off-grid
- Lewis & Harris - explore the last stretch of the outer hebrides

Following, some past trips.

### Bute (2)
Bute lies between Glasgow and Kintyre, Bute lies in the Firth of Clyde, not far from Arran. It is easily accessible from Glasgow taking a 50m train to Wemyss Bay and a 35m ferry. Both trips were day trips from Glasgow, one in spring and one in summer '23. On the first one, after exploring Rothesay a bit, we went by bus down the East coast to Killchattan bay. From there we set off on a nice coastal hike past a lighthouse, nice bays, and eventually farms and the ruins of a chapel. On the second one, we explored a different direction and took the bus to Ettrick bay, walked past the long sand beach, past large farms, and back to the harbor in Port Bannatyne. Killchattan bay has lots of charme. It houses a row of buildings, a few boats, and a post office that also serves tea, sandwiches, and more. The whole room is filled with Titanic materials - a family-related obsession of the owner. The hiking path is, for the most part, remote and without buildings or people. The lighthouse is tiny, but offers lots of large stones around to have packed lunch. Afterwards, the path goes more uphill, offering nice views when approaching the nearby farms. After thinking the path goes only past the fields, we came to realise that we also need to cross through a field with cattle looking at us and a large field full of sheep with lambs. Carefully but quickly, we made our way back in a full circle to the bay and back by bus. A beautiful coastal hike that's not too challenging. The upper half explored on the second trip felt quite different. Less wild, more fields and farms. The beach is beatiful though and if the weather was nicer, it would have been worth hanging out there longer. The island also houses Mount Stuart, a 19th-century mansion with large well-kept gardens, but due to temporary closure, this will be for a future trip.

## Munros

With my excitement for the island life, I have not bagged many Munros yet. Although I try to climb any hills that promise good views, my Munro scratch-off poster makes me look lazy, so here some next wishes and bagged Munros!

### _Wishlist_
- Ben Lomond - close to Glasgow and I was told it is a beatiful hike 
- Beinn na Lap - remote peak but accessible with the West Highland Line train between Glasgow and Fort William


### Beinn Narnain
Beinn Narnain lies right before Beinn Ime, so the ascent is the same when coming from the Loch Long direction. The peak is nice and the views were better than the previous time, but even with gloves, the top was freezing with a layer of snow and ice-cold winds. (March '21) Made a second ascent two years later but decided to enjoy the views from just above the tree line rather than going all the way up. (June '23)

### Beinn Ime
Laying on the side of Loch Long and just a short hike away from Loch Lomond, Beinn Ime is a slightly tedius hike through the forest for the first half, which is rewarded with beautiful views once above the tree line during the second half. Also goes past a river with minor waterfalls, and there is a choice between three peaks. Some crazy local hill runners passed me on their way down at 8am. If it would not have started snowing once approaching the top, and heavy rain all the way down, the 20kg backpack with camping gear and supplies might have actually been worth it. (September '20)
