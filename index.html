      <!-- Personal description, motivations and background -->
      <p> I am a technology enthusiast and cosmopolitan citizen interested in big ideas. Commonly, I can be found thinking deeply about tech, business, finance, and space, applying a first-principles approach to make the world a better place. </p>

      <p> I study Computing Science and Mathematics at the University of Glasgow and Dalhousie University and aim to build the future with efficient algorithms and intelligent machines. </p>

      <p> In Glasgow, I led a <a href="https://www.guorbit.co.uk/">team</a> of engineers and scientists building an innovative satellite at my university. I also built new tools as a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Amazon-Video/">Amazon PV</a> and consulted the government and public services on digital transformation and strategy at <a href="https://www.bearingpoint.com/">BearingPoint</a>. In the past, I spent significants amount of time studying deep learning for computer vision and still work on data and decision science projects.</p>

      <p>I am broadly interested in algorithms, complexity, data, and novel technologies and applications of mathematics, particularly those that relate to sectors that are redefining existing paradigms. Therefore, I am very curious about disruptive companies, novel research, and ideas. </p>

      <p>My <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/frederik-g/">inbox</a> is always open. </p>

      <h2>Concepts & Ideas</h2>
      <p>Writing often helps collecting the many ideas and thoughts floating around when thinking deeply about something. Most end up on some piece of paper or notebook and are forgotten forever, but some that might prove interesting or even <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/useful.html">useful</a> end up <a href="https://github.com/glitznerf/writing">here</a>!</p>
