Hi there, I am a PhD Researcher and Minerva Scholar at the University of Glasgow.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Research Interests
I mainly work on problems in the areas of algorithmics and complexity, computational social choice, algorithmic game theory, combinatorics, and graph theory. Broadly, I am interested in theoretical computer science, fair algorithms, and mechanism design.

My current research is at the intersection of computing, mathematics, and economics, where I study matching and allocation problems with ordinal preferences in non-financial markets such as Stable Roommates, Student-Project Allocations, and more.

During my PhD, I am supervised by [Professor David Manlove](https://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~davidm/) and [Dr Sofiat Olaosebikan](https://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~sofiat/).

<p>&nbsp;</p>


### Working Papers
- Algorithmics and Combinatorics of Stable Cycles and Partitions in the Roommates Problem
- How (Un)solvable are Random Roommates Instances?

<p>&nbsp;</p>


### Publications
- Student-Project Allocation in the Matching Algorithm Toolkit, BSc Thesis, University of Glasgow, 2023.

<p>&nbsp;</p>


### Research Talks
- Stable Cycles and Partitions in the Roommates Problem, Postgraduate Combinatorial Conference (London School of Economics & University College London), 2024
- Student-Project Allocation in the Matching Algorithm Toolkit, BSc Project Presentation, 2023

### Teaching
I have a great passion for teaching and as a [Minerva Scholar](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/postgraduateresearch/prospectivestudents/minervascholarships/), I get the chance to spend a significant portion of my time with teaching and CS-education related topics and initiatives.

### Academic Experience
I have held a variety of academic positions, including my current role as Minerva Scholar (entry-level research and teaching position), and previous roles as an SSPS Project Lead (to significantly improve a second-year undergraduate computing course) and general Teaching Assistant (to support labs and tutorials as mentioned above).

In terms of other academic service, I have supported the University of Zurich's Blockchain Center as a voluntary research engineer, represented my undergraduate cohort to both the school of computing and the school of mathematics & statistics, and acted as a Peer Assisted Learning Mentor for new undergraduate computing students.

<p>&nbsp;</p>


### Industry Experience
Before joining the world of academia full-time, I gained industry experiences as a Software Dev Engineer at Amazon (in workflow and process automation), Consultant for BearingPoint (mainly supporting information security and privacy projects for government and public sector clients), and in IT Dev & Ops at the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>


### Other Activities and Responsibilities
Before researching theoretical computer science, I thought I would end up in the space industry and was very active in [GU Orbit](https://uk.linkedin.com/company/gu-orbit), a University society for near-space and orbital projects. At the time, I also had the chance to join a European Space Agency [project for rocket science](https://www.esa.int/Education/Fly_A_Rocket). 

These days, I am probably either repairing things at [Repair Cafe Glasgow](https://repaircafeglasgow.org/), working on a design or diy project, or [exploring the Scottish highlands and islands](scotland).
