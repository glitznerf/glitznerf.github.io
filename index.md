Hi there, I am a PhD Researcher and Minerva Scholar at the University of Glasgow, holding a BSc (Hons) in Computing Science and Mathematics.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Research Interests
I mainly work on problems in the areas of algorithmics and complexity, computational social choice, algorithmic game theory, combinatorics, and graph theory. Broadly, I am interested in the theory of computation, exact and approximation algorithms, mechanism design, and fairness.

My current research is at the intersection of computing, mathematics, and economics, where I study matching and allocation problems with ordinal preferences in non-financial markets such as Stable Roommates, Student-Project Allocations, and more.

For my PhD research, I am supervised by [Professor David Manlove](https://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~davidm/) and [Dr Sofiat Olaosebikan](https://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~sofiat/).

<p>&nbsp;</p>


### Working Papers
- Algorithmics and Combinatorics of Stable Cycles and Partitions in the Roommates Problem
- How (Un)solvable are Random Roommates Instances?

<p>&nbsp;</p>


### Publications
- Student-Project Allocation in the Matching Algorithm Toolkit, BSc Thesis, University of Glasgow, 2023.

<p>&nbsp;</p>


### Teaching
I have a great passion for teaching and as a [Minerva scholar](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/postgraduateresearch/prospectivestudents/minervascholarships/), I get the chance to spend a significant portion (roughly 1/3) of my time with tutoring & marking, (in the future) lecturing & project supervision, and other CS education activities and initiatives within the school.
