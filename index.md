I am a PhD Researcher and Minerva Scholar at the University of Glasgow, holding a BSc (Hons) in Computing Science and Mathematics. My academic supervisors are [Professor David Manlove](https://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~davidm/) and [Dr Sofiat Olaosebikan](https://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~sofiat/).

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Research Interests
I work on problems in the areas of algorithmics and complexity, computational social choice, combinatorics, and graph theory. Broadly, I am interested in the theory of computation, exact and approximation algorithms, mechanism design, algorithmic game theory, and fairness.

My current research is at the intersection of mathematics, computing, and economics, where I study matching and allocation problems with ordinal preferences in non-financial markets such as Stable Roommates, Student-Project Allocations, and more.

<p>&nbsp;</p>


## Working Papers
- Algorithmics and Combinatorics of Stable Cycles and Partitions in the Roommates Problem
- How (Un)solvable are Random Roommates Instances?

<p>&nbsp;</p>


## Publications
- Student-Project Allocation in the Matching Algorithm Toolkit, BSc Thesis, University of Glasgow, 2023.
