Hi there, I am a PhD Researcher and Minerva Scholar at the University of Glasgow.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Research Interests
I mainly work on problems in the areas of algorithmics and complexity, computational social choice, algorithmic game theory, combinatorics, and graph theory. Broadly, I am interested in theoretical computer science, fair algorithms, and mechanism design.

My current research is at the intersection of computing, mathematics, and economics, where I study matching and allocation problems with ordinal preferences in non-financial markets such as Stable Roommates, Student-Project Allocations, and more. Most of my research is theoretical (e.g., proving theorems), but I am also excited about experimental research, applications and tools (e.g., see [matwa.optimalmatching.com](https://matwa.optimalmatching.com/)). I am lucky to be supervised by [Professor David Manlove](https://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~davidm/) and [Dr Sofiat Olaosebikan](https://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~sofiat/).

### Teaching
I have a great passion for teaching and, as a [Minerva Scholar](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/postgraduateresearch/prospectivestudents/minervascholarships/), I get the chance to spend a significant portion of my time with teaching and CS-education related topics and initiatives. Some courses I have supported are listed below (ordered in reverse-chronological order).

- [**Quantum Computing** (H)](https://www.gla.ac.uk/coursecatalogue/course/?code=COMPSCI4105) - _Tutor:_ **2025** (~50 total students)
- [**Algorithms and Data Structures** 2](https://www.gla.ac.uk/coursecatalogue/course/?code=COMPSCI2007) - _Tutor and Marker:_ **2023, 2024, 2025** (~420 total students)
- [**Algorithmics** 1 (H)](https://www.gla.ac.uk/coursecatalogue/course/?code=COMPSCI4009) - _Tutor:_ **2024** (~300 total students)
- [**Algorithmic Foundations** 2](https://www.gla.ac.uk/coursecatalogue/course/?code=COMPSCI2003) - _Tutor and Marker:_ **2024** (~120 total students)

### Academic Experience
I have held a variety of academic positions, including my current role as **Minerva Scholar** (entry-level research and teaching position), and previous roles as an **SSPS Project Lead** (to improve a second-year undergraduate computing course) and general **Teaching Assistant**.

In terms of other academic service, I am **organising the 29th Postgraduate Combinatorial Conference** ([PCC 2025](https://sites.google.com/view/pcc2025/home)) in Glasgow, am a member of the **British Combinatorial Committee** ([BCC](https://www.britishcombinatorics.org.uk/)) and the School's **Learning & Teaching Committee**. In the past, I have supported the [University of Zurich's Blockchain Center](https://www.blockchain.uzh.ch/) as a voluntary **Research Engineer**, represented my undergraduate cohort to the School of Computing Science and the School of Mathematics and Statistics as a **Class Rep**, and acted as a **Peer Assisted Learning Mentor** for new undergraduate computing students.

### Editorial Activities
PC Chair: [PCC25](https://sites.google.com/view/pcc2025/home) (postgraduate- and abstract-only)

Reviewer: [JDAM](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/discrete-applied-mathematics), [SODA25](https://www.siam.org/conferences-events/siam-conferences/soda25/) (external)

<p>&nbsp;</p>


### Industry Experience
Before joining academia full-time, I gained industry experiences as a **Software Dev Engineer** at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/video/livetv) (automating workflows and processes), **Consultant** for [BearingPoint](https://www.bearingpoint.com/en-gb/) (supporting information security and privacy projects for government and public sector clients), and in **IT Dev & Ops** (building data processing and visualisation tools for large datasets) at the [Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation](https://www.gleif.org/en). 

<p>&nbsp;</p>


### Other Activities
I thought I would end up in the **space** industry and was very active in [GU Orbit](https://uk.linkedin.com/company/gu-orbit), a University society for near-space and orbital projects. At the time, I also had the chance to join a European Space Agency [project for rocket science](https://www.esa.int/Education/Fly_A_Rocket). 

These days, I am probably either **repairing** things at [Repair Cafe Glasgow](https://repaircafeglasgow.org/), working on a **design** or **diy** project, or [exploring the Scottish **highlands** and **islands**](scotland).
