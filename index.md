Hi there, I am a PhD Researcher and Minerva Scholar at the University of Glasgow.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Research Interests
I mainly work on problems in the areas of algorithmics and complexity, computational social choice, algorithmic game theory, combinatorics, and graph theory. Broadly, I am interested in theoretical computer science, fair algorithms, and mechanism design.

My current research is at the intersection of computing, mathematics, and economics, where I study matching and allocation problems with ordinal preferences in non-financial markets such as Stable Roommates, Student-Project Allocations, and more.

During my PhD, I am supervised by [Professor David Manlove](https://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~davidm/) and [Dr Sofiat Olaosebikan](https://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~sofiat/).

### Teaching
I have a great passion for teaching and, as a [Minerva Scholar](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/postgraduateresearch/prospectivestudents/minervascholarships/), I get the chance to spend a significant portion of my time with teaching and CS-education related topics and initiatives. Some courses I have supported are listed below.

#### 2024
- [Algorithmics](https://www.gla.ac.uk/coursecatalogue/course/?code=COMPSCI2026) - _TA (Tutorial and Lab Tutor)_
- [Algorithms and Data Structures 2](https://www.gla.ac.uk/coursecatalogue/course/?code=COMPSCI2007) - _TA (Lab Tutor and Marker)_

#### 2023
- [Algorithms and Data Structures 2](https://www.gla.ac.uk/coursecatalogue/course/?code=COMPSCI2007) - _TA (Lab Demonstrator)_
- [Networks and Operating Systems Essentials 2](https://www.gla.ac.uk/coursecatalogue/course/?code=COMPSCI2024) - _Creating materials and helping out in lab sessions_

#### 2022
- [Networks and Operating Systems Essentials 2](https://www.gla.ac.uk/coursecatalogue/course/?code=COMPSCI2024) - _TA (Lab Demonstrator)_

I also had fun helping out at the [Glasgow Science Festival 2024](https://www.gla.ac.uk/events/sciencefestival/)!

### Academic Experience
I have held a variety of academic positions, including my current role as **Minerva Scholar** (entry-level research and teaching position), and previous roles as an **SSPS Project Lead** (to significantly improve a second-year undergraduate computing course) and general **Teaching Assistant**.

In terms of other academic service, I am in the **Learning & Teaching Committee**, am **organising** the 29th **Postgraduate Combinatorial Conference** ([PCC 2025](https://sites.google.com/view/pcc2025/home)) in Glasgow, have supported the University of Zurich's Blockchain Center as a voluntary **Research Engineer**, represented my undergraduate cohort to both the school of computing and the school of mathematics as a **Class Rep**, and acted as a **Peer Assisted Learning Mentor** for new undergraduate computing students.

<p>&nbsp;</p>


### Industry Experience
Before joining academia full-time, I gained industry experiences as a **Software Dev Engineer** at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/video/livetv) (in workflow and process automation), **Consultant** for [BearingPoint](https://www.bearingpoint.com/en-gb/) (mainly supporting information security and privacy projects for government and public sector clients), and in **IT Dev & Ops** at the [Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation](https://www.gleif.org/en). 

<p>&nbsp;</p>


### Other Activities
I thought I would end up in the **space** industry and was very active in [GU Orbit](https://uk.linkedin.com/company/gu-orbit), a University society for near-space and orbital projects. At the time, I also had the chance to join a European Space Agency [project for rocket science](https://www.esa.int/Education/Fly_A_Rocket). 

These days, I am probably either **repairing** things at [Repair Cafe Glasgow](https://repaircafeglasgow.org/), working on a **design** or **diy** project, or [exploring the Scottish **highlands** and **islands**](scotland).
