I am a PhD Researcher and Minerva Scholar at the University of Glasgow. My academic supervisors are [Professor David Manlove](https://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~davidm/) and [Dr Sofiat Olaosebikan](https://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~sofiat/).


## Research Interests
I work in the areas of algorithmics and complexity, combinatorics, graph theory, and computational social choice. Broadly, I am interested in the theory of computation, complexity, optimisation, exact and approximation algorithms, fairness, algorithmic game theory, and mechanism design.

My current research is at the intersection of mathematics, computing, and economics, where I study matching and allocation problems with ordinal preferences in non-financial markets such as Stable Roommates, Student-Project Allocations, and more.
